There exists a dire need of a student
assistance/helpline program to identify risk factors for suicide, 
and the implementation of a prevention 
policy to promote adolescentsâ€™ resilience 
and healthy socio-emotional development.
I will be creating a website for this purpose in 
which certain deatils will be asked by the user
Like social networking mail,family info,bank account details
,family,etc.After that ,there will be regular monitoring
Of the user and in case any of the symptoms
Indicates possibility of suicide attempt then it will be directed 
to respective committee and database will be updated.

Percentage share of various causes and their solutions of suicides in order of contribution to people committing suicides are listed below:

Family problems [27.6%]=>
The social networking will be helpful in resolving
this,if any issue is felt then their data
will be directly sent to helpline call center for 
proper guidance and care.Data monitoring will be
continuously done throughout the scope of
a particular account.Proper funding 
from the government to monetarily
activate the helpline center's.

Illness [15.8%]=>Contact Funding agencies (including NIA
,NICHD, NIDA, NIAAA, CDC, SAMHSA and
 DVA)for encouraging measures 
of suicidality (e.g., attempts) be 
included in all large and/or 
long-term studies of health behaviors, 
mental health interventions, and genetic studies of mental disorder.
Hospitalization for those with low adherence 
to collaboration for help and those who
require monitoring & secondary symptom 
treatment.Physicians should refer patients 
with multiple risk factors to consultation with a 
mental health professional.

Marriage related issues and love 
affairs[4.6%]=>
For this, relationship advisory committee
will be contacted and funded by govt.
giving people hope for a better life 
after current problems are resolved.This committee members
will be rated according to their positive outcomes
and will be available everytime for the user.
I will ensure this utility in my website.


Bankruptcy or indebtedness [3.3%]
Creating & using crisis cards, an uncluttered 
card formatted readably that describes 
a list of activities one should follow 
in crisis until the positive behavior
responses settles in the personality.

Drug abuse/addiction [3.7%]
Registering with support groups like
Alcoholics Anonymous, Suicide Bereavement 
Support Group, a religious group with
flow rituals, etc.Therapeutic recreational therapy 
that improves mood.Motivating self-care activities 
like physical exercise's and meditative relaxation.

Unemployment [4.0%]and failure in examination [14.0%]
Structured counseling and 
Supportive therapy like substance 
abuse treatment, Psychotropic medication, 
Family psychoeducation and Access to 
emergency phone call care with emergency rooms, 
suicide prevention hotlines, etc.
Various Programs for suicide prevention should 
be developed, tested, expanded, and implemented 
through funding from appropriate agencies 
including NIMH, DVA, CDC, and SAMHSA.Links
for these programs will be inculcated mainly on
exams and job results websites for reference to
Student at the very moment.
